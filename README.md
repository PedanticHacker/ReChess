# ReChess

## What's this?

ReChess is an app for playing chess against a chess engine.

## In what programming language is ReChess written?

That would be **Python**.

### What version of Python are we talking about here?

It would be best if you launch ReChess using Python **3.12**.

### Why 3.12?

As tested, ReChess works on all major platforms using Python 3.12, so on
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### What about other Python versions?

ReChess should work using a Python version older than 3.12, but surely
won't work using a 2.x version. Feel free to modify the source code to
adapt it to your specific Python version, if necessary.

## Are there any dependencies?

Yes. ReChess depends upon:

- **psutil**: A library for getting operating system metrics
- **PySide6**: A framework for developing cross-platform GUI apps
- **python-chess**: A library for developing chess apps

### Is there any 3rd-party software used?

Yes. ReChess uses **Stockfish**, a powerful UCI chess engine for playing
and analyzing.

## What features does ReChess provide?

You get all the basic features for playing chess:

- chess clocks
- SVG chessboard
- FEN editor
- table for displaying chess move notation in SAN format

### Is that it?

There are also many functionalities you can utilize:

- navigate through move history by scrolling your mouse wheel upwards or
downwards, or making a corresponding touchpad gesture, and play a game
from whatever historic move onwards, if you like
- play against the latest official version of the Stockfish chess engine
- analyze a chessboard position
- load a chess engine to play against it or to analyze with it
- flip the chessboard
- force the chess engine to make a move when its opponent is on turn
- paste a FEN from the clipboard by double-clicking the FEN editor, then
analyze the chessboard position or play a game from there onwards

## Which chess variants are supported?

Only standard chess is supported. Chess variants are not supported.

## How do I move a piece on the chessboard?

Making a move in ReChess is as simple as a click. Just click a piece and
then click one of its legal squares to make your move.

### How do I know what's the legal square of a piece?

After you click a piece, all of its legal squares get marked with a dot.

### Can I drag and then drop a piece?

No. Drag-and-drop functionality is not supported.

## How does ReChess look?

## What's the default chess engine in ReChess?

The latest version of the **Stockfish** chess engine is the default. It
works on Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

### What if I want to play against some other chess engine?

You can load and play against any chess engine in ReChess, but make sure
it is a UCI chess engine.

### Why does it have to be a UCI chess engine?

Chess engines, compatible only with CECP and designed for a WinBoard or
an XBoard GUI, can't be loaded and played against in ReChess because it
doesn't support this protocol. If your chess engine also supports UCI,
then you're in luck.

### Can I do a chessboard position analysis?

Yes. You can analyze a chessboard position with the default chess engine
or the one you load yourself.

## Are there any requirements I must have for ReChess?

Yes. You should have specific requirements installed.

1. Install this version of the Python programming language:

    - [**Python 3.12.5**](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.5/python-3.12.5-amd64.exe)

2. In your command-line interface, install:
    - **psutil**, by executing the command `pip install psutil`
    - **PySide6**, by executing the command `pip install PySide6`
    - **python-chess**, by executing the command `pip install chess`

Alternatively, you can also install these three requirements with the
*pip* package manager in your command-line interface within ReChess's
top-level directory, if Python is installed, then execute this command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How can I launch ReChess?

After installing ReChess's requirements, launch your favorite IDE (e.g.,
PyCharm, VSCode, Wing, Spyder, etc.) or your favorite source-code editor
(e.g., Sublime Text, Notepad++, UltraEdit, Atom, etc.), then run the
`main.py` file found in ReChess's top-level directory.

Alternatively, you can also execute this command in your command-line
interface within ReChess's top-level directory:

```bash
python main.py
```
