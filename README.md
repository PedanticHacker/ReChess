# ReChess

A GUI app for playing chess against a UCI chess engine.

### Source Code

ReChess's source code is written in the **Python** programming language.
ReChess should be launched with the Python interpreter version 3.12.

You may edit the source code to make it work with older versions of the
Python interpreter, but note that using version 3.12 guarantees that
ReChess will work on Windows, Linux-based, and macOS platforms.

### Dependencies

ReChess depends upon and extensively uses the **PySide6** GUI framework
and the **python-chess** library.

### 3rd-Party Software

ReChess integrates the **Stockfish** chess engine.

### UI Components

ReChess provides all the UI components for playing chess, which include
an SVG board with pieces, chess clocks, a FEN record editor, and a table
for displaying chess move notation in SAN (Standard Algebraic Notation)
format.

### Game Rules

ReChess adheres only to the rules of standard chess.

> [!NOTE]
> Chess variants are not supported.

### Chess Moves

To make a chess move, click the origin square of a chess piece and then
click its legal square.

> [!NOTE]
> Drag-and-drop functionality for making chess moves is not supported.

### Legal Square Markers

After you click a chess piece, its legal squares are marked with a dot.

## Chess Engine Integration & Protocol Compatibility

The Stockfish chess engine is integrated in ReChess by default and works
on Windows, Linux-based, and macOS platforms.

Custom chess engines can also be loaded and played against in ReChess,
provided they are compatible with the UCI protocol.

## CECP Protocol Compatibility

The chess engines, compatible only with the CECP protocol and designed
for a WinBoard or an XBoard GUI cannot be loaded and played against in
ReChess. It is required that all chess engines are compatible with the
UCI protocol for proper integration and gameplay availability.

## Requirements

The requirements listed below must be installed on your platform before
you can successfully launch ReChess. Use the provided links to install
any requirement you might be missing.

1. Install the Python programming language:

    - [**Python 3.12.4**](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.4/python-3.12.4-amd64.exe)

2. In a command-line interface with admin privileges, install these:

    - **PySide6**, by executing the command `pip install PySide6`
    - **python-chess**, by executing the command `pip install chess`

Alternatively, install **PySide6** and **python-chess** with the pip
package manager in your command-line interface with admin privileges
within ReChess's top-level directory by executing this command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Launch ReChess

After installing all of ReChess' requirements, launch your favorite IDE
(e.g., PyCharm, VSCode, Wing, Spyder, etc.) or your favorite code editor
(e.g., Sublime Text, Notepad++, UltraEdit, Atom, etc.), then build the
`main.py` file found in ReChess's top-level directory.

Alternatively, execute the `python main.py` command in your command-line
interface within ReChess's top-level directory.
