# ReChess 1.0

## What's this?

This is ReChess, an app for playing chess against an engine.

## How can I get started quickly?

Here's what you need to do:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.13 installed. If not, read below:

    - For Windows, :point_right: [click here to download Python 3.13 installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.3/python-3.13.3-amd64.exe) :point_left:
    - For Linux, execute `sudo apt-get install python3.13` in the
      terminal or execute a command applicable for the package manager
      of your Linux distribution
    - For macOS, :point_right: [click here to download Python 3.13 installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.3/python-3.13.3-macos11.pkg) :point_left:

2. Install required packages by executing this command in the terminal
   from within ReChess's top-level directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

:point_right: On macOS, the `pip` command is written as `pip3`.

3. Launch ReChess by executing this command in the terminal from within
   ReChess's top-level directory:

```bash
python main.py
```

:point_right: On macOS, the `python` command is written as `python3`.

4. Start playing by doing this:

    - Start dragging a piece to see its legal target squares.
    - Drag the piece to a legal target square and drop it there to make
      your move.
    - Use the Settings button to customize your experience.

## In what programming language is ReChess written?

That would be **Python**.

### What version of Python are we talking about here?

It would be best if you launch ReChess using Python **3.13**.

### Why 3.13 specifically?

As tested, ReChess works on all major platforms using Python 3.13, so on
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### What about other Python versions?

ReChess should work using a Python version older than 3.13, but surely
won't work using a 2.x version. If required, modify the source code to
adapt it to your specific Python version.

## Are there any dependencies?

Yes. ReChess depends upon:

- **python-chess**: A library for developing chess apps
- **psutil**: A library for getting operating system metrics
- **PySide6**: A framework for developing cross-platform GUI apps

### Is there any 3rd-party software integrated?

Yes. ReChess integrates **Stockfish**, a powerful engine for playing and
analyzing a game.

## What features does ReChess provide?

You get all the basic building blocks for playing chess:

- board
- clocks
- FEN editor
- table view for showing Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN)

### Is that it?

There are also many features you can use:

- flip the board
- analyze a position
- load an engine of your choice
- force the engine to make a move
- navigate through moves of the game
- select from one of the dark or light styles
- play against the latest version of the Stockfish engine
- paste a FEN from the clipboard by double-clicking the FEN editor

## Which chess variants are supported?

Chess variants are not supported.

## How do I move a piece on the board?

Making a move in ReChess is as simple as a drag. Just drag a piece on
one of its legal squares and then drop it there to make your move.

### How do I know which legal squares are available for a piece?

After you start dragging a piece, all of its legal squares get marked
with a dot. That's how you know.

## How does ReChess look?

The following screenshots show how ReChess looks in **Dark mint** style.

## What's the default engine in ReChess?

The latest version of **Stockfish** is the default engine. It works on
Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

### What if I want to play against some other engine?

You can load and then play against or analyze with any engine, but it
has to be a UCI-compliant one.

### Why does it have to be a UCI-compliant engine?

An engine compliant only with Chess Engine Communication Protocol (CECP)
and designed for either the WinBoard GUI (on the Windows platform) or
the XBoard GUI (on a Linux-based platform) can't be loaded in ReChess,
because it doesn't support this type of protocol. If your engine is also
compliant with Universal Chess Interface (UCI), then you're in luck.

### Can I analyze a position?

Yes. You can analyze a position with the default Stockfish engine or a
UCI-compliant engine you load yourself.
